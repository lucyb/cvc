# CVC Password

Generate a password designed for high memorability and security. 

This uses a CVC-CVC-CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant) construction. It provides a list of three randomly generated passwords, so the most memorable one can be selected.

It follows the advice given in the GCHQ password guidance document.

## How does it work?

You'll need python3, that's it. 

Install using 

'''python setup.py install'''

Then just type 'cvc'.
