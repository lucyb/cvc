# CVC Password

Generate a password designed for high memorability and security. 

This uses a CVC-CVC-CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant) construction. It provides a list of three randomly generated passwords, so the most memorable one can be selected.

It follows the advice given in the [GCHQ CESG password guidance document (pdf)] (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/458857/Password_guidance_-_simplifying_your_approach.pdf).

## How does it work?

You'll need python3, that's it. 

Install using setup tools by doing:
```
#!bash

python setup.py install
```

Then just type 'cvc'.
